<h1>Who Makes America?</h1>
<div>
<p>On March 27th, 1999 my parents became naturalized citizens in the United States of America. I was born two months later. I recently discovered this information while I was sifting through my parents documents, back at home as a result of the pandemic. I already knew the story of their arrival. On a sweltering June day in 1992, clad in everything that they couldn’t squeeze into their suitcases, my family entered John F. Kennedy International Airport. Seven years later I was born. They came here with next to nothing (they had less than 100 dollars to their name and three suitcases). My parents eventually settled in upstate New York, bought a house and achieved that particular American dream of 2.5 kids and house with a car in the garage. 

	<br><br>

Americans love this story. We love to hear how someone pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and through hard work and perseverance made all of their dreams come true. America also despises immigrants. Historically there has been opposition to every immigrant group that resettled in America, from the Know-Nothing party opposing Irish and German immigrants in the 1800s to the internment of Japanese Americans to recent history in which migrants seeking asylum were put into detention centers and children were separated from their parents. While some Americans refuse to acknowledge the contributions of immigrant labor, the truth is that in 2018, in New York alone <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/immigrants/downloads/pdf/moia_annual_report_2018_final.pdf">immigrants contributed about 22% of the city's total GDP.</a>  

<br><br>

The initial success of immigrant children seems promising. According to a 2015 study outlined in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/second-generation-immigrants-outperform-others-in-school/431943/">The Atlantic</a> <b>"second-generation students outperform first-generation students on standardized tests and third-generation immigrants on school grades."  </b> </p>

<p> The chart below illustrates how while foreign born Americans are less likely to graduate highschool or college than those who are born in the U.S., the children of immigrants are more likely to obtain a bachelor's degree than their peers whose parents are from the U.S. </p>

<p>This information fits into the narrative of the American dream. By coming to America, your children are better off, and therefore they will be more successful and high achieving. The reality is that children with immigrant parents not only act as a bridge between their families and their external culture, but also shoulder the burden of their parents' expectations. My mother sums it up with "we didn't come to America for you to get a B+ in English". In comparison to the menial labor my mother had to do when she arrived in the United States, how could the stresses of my privileged life as an American teenager compare. Second generation children are pressured to succeed in order to overcompensate for their parents and to make their parents sacrifice seem “worthwhile” </p>



<p> However, as this <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/120352/why-americanization-makes-immigrant-children-less-successful">study</a> suggests, the reality is that immigrant children still struggle to achieve their own American dream. </p>



<p class ="block"> <b> "The longer immigrant children live in this country, the worse, on average, their health, their attitude, and their school performance. What's more, with each subsequent generation, immigrant children do worse and worse. On average, first-generation children function at significantly higher levels than do typical American-born children. But, by the third generation, that advantage is gone."</b></p>

<p> 
While the chart above shows how immigrant children can surpass their American counterparts, later generations tend to graduate highschool and college at the same rate as those without immigrant grandparents. 

<br><br>

I am a first generation American who is grappling with the painful reality that I might not be as successful as my parents. I wanted to know if other first generation Americans felt the same way. 
<br><br>


I spoke with five first-generation Americans from different backgrounds to learn more about the first-gen experience can vary and how it stays the same, regardless of ethnic or socioeconomic background. Gabby Francis, a 21 year-old student from Astoria, Queens was the first child born to her parents after they moved to America from Trinidad and Tobago. Gabby describes the struggles she faced while growing up. She says “ I think the best way to sum it up was an identity crisis, it was constantly trying to find a place to belong. When you're displaced, it's really hard to do that.”
<br><br>

Gabby continues to describe her childhood and the duality of being first gen:

<p class ="block2"> <b>“I was kind of living a double life, essentially acting like this American kid at school and tried to fit in and eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because everyone did. But at home even like curry and rice, and roti and stuff that I didn't bring to school because I was ashamed of it for a really long time.” </b></p>

<br><br>

<p> Indeed, many second generation immigrants make a significant effort to assimilate, and succeed in doing so. The chart below shows how, while first generation Hispanic and Asian Americans would decribe themselves as "very different from a typical American" by the second generation, a mojority of both immigrant groups say that they are "a typical American."
